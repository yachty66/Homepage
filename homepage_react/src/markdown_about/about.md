You can find a list with the things I am currently working on [here](https://maxhager.xyz/projects).

Previously, I was running a drug business from a small town in East Germany and then moved to Berlin where I studied Applied Computer Science. During that time I worked at different companies. I lived in different group houses and met a lot of good friends. After my graduation, I moved now into the Bay Area for maximizing good outcomes out of serendipity. Really looking forward to this.
