You can find a list with the things I am currently working on [here](https://maxhager.xyz/projects).

I grew up in East Germany and than moved to Berlin where I studied Applied Computer Science. During that time I worked at different companies and lived in different group houses where I met a lot of good friends. After my graduation, I moved now into the Bay Area for maximizing good outcomes out of serendipity. Really looking forward to this.
