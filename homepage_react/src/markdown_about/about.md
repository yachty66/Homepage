You can find a list with the things I am currently working on [here](some link to add).

Previously, I was running a drug business from a small town in east germany and than moved to Berlin where I studied applied computer science. During that time I worked at different companies and startups. In Berlin I lived in different group houses and had a lot of fun with friends. I am looking forward to move into the Bay Area for maximizing good outcomes out of serendepity.
