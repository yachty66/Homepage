Working on something new.

Previously, I was a software engineer working on open-source Kubernetes at Google, building and maintaining Kubernetes developer tools such as minikube and skaffold. I also worked on machine learning pipelines as a maintainer of the Kubeflow project. Before Google, I worked at The Blackstone Group in NYC. [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)

I received a BA in Mathematics from Columbia University. I have an MBA from Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I was an Arjay Miller Scholar.
