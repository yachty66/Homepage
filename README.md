## Projects Description

Personal homepage where I share informations about myself, posts and the projects I am working on. I offer a newsletter that is sent out once a week and summarizes the posts and projects I've been working on over the past week. The idea is to pass this newsletter on to my family as well to keep them up to date.

## Overview

- [ ] create a header witht my name, about, posts, projects and subscribe + twitter in the format like matt rickard
- [ ] create a main section which is supporting full markdown functionality and add some text for the about section
- [ ] create a universal class or something where i can change the color of the font everywhere
- [ ] create a posts section where each entry gets automatically the date of today added to. headline gets created via parsing from header of markdown file 
- [ ] create a first post who demonstrates code blocks, images, bullet points, lists, distances and equations and on the bottom add a subscribe button in the matt style
- [ ] add my projects site (need to make it completely new)
- [ ] share it to my family and to my friends (also daan because he once had the idea of creating a newsletter)
- [ ] best case build it as reuseable framework for other people because i would love to see other people tracking their projects and its a unique frame work which i havtn seen yet so really interesting. perhaps i can even build a small simple gui which makes it super simple adding your projects 

## Steps 

- [ ] create repo
